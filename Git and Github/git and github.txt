Git => version control software to track content and allow multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously.

Commit:
    The "commit" command is used to save your changes to the local repository.

Branch:
    pointer to a snapshot of the changes. The default branch name in Git is master . 
    As you start making commits, youâ€™re given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. 
    Every time you commit, the master branch pointer moves forward automatically.

Github:
    Repo hosting service for software development and version control using git.

* Git is a version control software whereas github uses git to allow users to remotely host their code and allow others to contribute.
